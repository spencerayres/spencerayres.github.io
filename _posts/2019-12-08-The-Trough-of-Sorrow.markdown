**I've been reflecting on my experience building a startup recently and I seem to be constantly seeing this image of A Day In The Life of an Entrepreneur. It represents the journey an entrepreneur goes on along the way to building a successful business.**


It’s a diagonal line. But it’s by no means direct. You go through these moments of pure joy where everything is brilliant. At these times, the conversations usually looks like something like this.

Then suddenly there's massive drop of confidence where everything gets a lot more bleak and you begin to question yourself.

I’ve been thinking about how this pattern happens to you not just as an entrepreneur. It also reflects the experiences you have when you work on any creative project where success isn’t guaranteed. 

So it could be happening to you in your work, your social life, your personal life or even your family life.

But the thing about being in a startup and being an entrepreneur is that it's super condensed and you kind of go through this, this pattern almost on a daily basis. 

I remember yesterday I came into work in such a great mood, I was feeling like “I’ve totally got this”. Then, within within an hour I was like, there's no way that we can pull this off; what we're trying to do is just too hard.

Then almost immediately, I kind of got on with it and smashed out a few tasks we weren’t even planning to get done yet.

These patterns of up and down can happen over a day, a week, a month or a year. 

The important thing is how you bounce back from these setbacks because that’s what makes you a stronger person and a stronger leader.

Sometimes, as an entrepreneur, you need to hit low points in order to realise that you've got to change what you're doing and pull yourself out of it because no one else is going to do it for you.
