I talk and write about design, learning and technology.

Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer at Future Builders - we help people build their careers and businesses build their future workforce. Ensuring people remain relevant and companies stay competitive.

I also started a design and training agency called Making Ideas Work. We're still going, focused mainly on running design sprints for companies & training staff on Design Thinking, Innovation and Tech.

Before this I launched & ran Makers Apprenticeships - a new venture within Makers Academy with the goal to create the leading technology Apprenticeship Programme in the Country. Went from idea to execution and multimillion revenues in 1 year.
